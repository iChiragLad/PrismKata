# PrismKata
A startup project for a Prism 6 + WPF + MVVM Kata.

This project is a kickstart project for exercising the MVVM pattern implementation using WPF and the Prism6 library.

The starting point is a simple WPF app with a main view (MainWindow), and two child views (ViewA an ViewB).

The Kata is intended to train the developer in automating the usual steps of implementing WPF and MVVM with help of Prism:

1. Implementing Property change notification the classic way, and then switch to Prisms BindableBase

2. Implement Commands and Command binding

3. Implement View-to-ViewModel wiring

4. Implement DI for decoupling

5. Implement Event Aggregation (Observer pattern) for communicating between ViewModels

... more to come
